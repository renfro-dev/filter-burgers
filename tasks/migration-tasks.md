I'm migrating a complex n8n newsletter processing workflow to Supabase Edge Functions. Please read these key context files to understand the project:

@docs/n8n-analysis.md - Current n8n workflow analysis
@tasks/migration-tasks.md - Development tasks and priorities  
@.cursorrules - Project configuration and guidelines

Current focus: TASK-001 (Gmail API Setup)

Please analyze the current system and suggest the best approach for implementing Gmail API integration that matches the existing n8n workflow behavior.
